- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code on codecademy. I have completed beginner and intermediate Python 3 and I'm now working on the full-stack engineer career path. I currently have exposure to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, along with Git, GitHub, and VS Code
- 💞️ I would like to join a small/medium team so that I can gain exposure to the full-stack, while making a meaningful contribution
- 📫 How to reach me: jeremykeeling@hotmail.co.uk
