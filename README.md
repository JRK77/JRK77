- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code on codecademy. I have completed beginner and intermediate Python 3 and I'm now working on the full-stack engineer career path alongside learning C# and Java. I currently have exposure to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, C#, Java, along with Git, GitHub, VS Code, and ASP.NET
- 💞️ I have been offered my dream job as an apprentice full-stack engineer with an amazing organisation, beginning in September 2022
